            <p>
            Poverty, seasonal migration, rigid patriarchal structure, parental apathy, domestic insecurity, unattractive format of education, societal ridicule, discrimination in schools and community dialect are hindrances in the spread of education among marginalised especially DNTs communities  which hampers the level of learning among children poses a great challenge.   </p>
           <p>Access to quality education can change a child’s life, specially for children from marginalized communities. It can be the light that they need to change the direction of their life, it can be the hope they need to understand that there are better days ahead…

​</p>
<p>
An environment that promotes education, in school and at homes, plays a crucial role in helping the child become interested in going to school, receiving education and ultimately becoming empowered and independent. We work with children at two levels – Inside the school and outside the school, and build our strategies accordingly.           </p>
